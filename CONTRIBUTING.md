## How to contribute to Sickle

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/BSFishy/Sickle/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/BSFishy/Sickle/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Create a new pull request specifically stating so, and make sure it does not affect the functionality of the code.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Create a new [issue](https://github.com/BSFishy/Sickle/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) and when you have some working code, make a [pull request](https://github.com/BSFishy/Sickle/compare).
