# Sickle
Sickle is a general purpose programming language that is heavily based on Swift. The goal is to have a language that is cross platform, yet has some of the defining features of Swift. Some of these features include optionals, extended properties, and extensions.

## Building
This section is to-do, but it should be as straight forward as running `./gradlew build`(or just `gradlew build` on Windows), and the output file should be in `build/libs`.
